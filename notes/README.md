# 1. Getting started with Notes Microservice

# 1.1. Composing docker container

Switch to notes directory from notes-microservices:

\$ cd notes

Then start a composed docker container by command:

The command will set everything up. Make sure ports mentioned in docker-compose.yml are available on your machine.

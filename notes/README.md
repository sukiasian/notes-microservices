# 1. Getting started with Users Microservice

# 1.1. Composing docker container

Switch to users directory from notes-microservices:

\$ cd users

Then start a composed docker container by command:

\$ docker-compose --env-file .env up

The command will set everything up. Make sure ports mentioned in docker-compose.yml are available on your machine.

# 2. Voila!

Server is ready.
